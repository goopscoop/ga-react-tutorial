# Setup (Before Class)

## Make sure you have the following tools:
- A Mac computer (Linix and Windows welcome, but I'll be able to offer very limited support if any issues pop up, especially with Windows)
- An IDE (Sublime, Atom, VIM or something similar)
- Google Chrome or FireFox
- Node.js installed

## Steps to take before class

### If you don't have Node.js installed
If you've already installed node, you can skip this step.

- Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and download node 4.2.4 (or the latest version of 4.x.x). Don't download version 5.x.x unless you know what you're doing.
- Open the installer and follow the instructions.

### Once node is installed

1. Clone this repo, then in terminal enter the following commands
2.  `git clone git@github.com:goopscoop/ga-react-tutorial.git`
3. `cd ga-react-tutorial`
4.  `npm install`
5.  `npm start`
6. In your web browser, enter the url `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/#/`. 
- You should see a bar at the top of the page that says "App ready." Below that, it'll say "Hello General Assembly. Welcome to React". If you see this, you're ready for class.
- If you don't see this, please let me know at the beginning of class.
- If you feel adventurous, go ahead and poke around the files. Most of what you'll find is general boilerplate that will make your dev experiance nicer.

## JSX

JSX is the HTML looking code that you'll find within the render method (and sprinkled throughout other custom methods) in React. While it looks like HTML, it's actually just JavaScript.

*Example*

```
// JSX
<h1 className="heading">Hello, world! I am an H1.</h1>

// Compiles to this
React.createElement('h1', {className: "heading"},
    "Hello, world! I am an H1."
)
```

## Flux (old) and Redux (new) - (Advanced Data Handling)

### Flux

Flux is a data handling methodology created by Facebook for React. One of the best implementations of Flux come in the form of Flummox. However, the React community is starting to move away from Flux towards a new data handling methodology called Redux.

### Redux

Many Flux implementations are slowing be abandoned for the new Redux methodology. In fact, the creator of Flummox has joined the Redux team. This is new tech and not as widely documented as Flux, so it has a steeper learning curve, however it appears to be the way data handling is headed for React (as well as many other frameworks)

## ES6 (ES2015)

ES6 aka ES2015 is the newest itteration of JavaScript that comes packaged with a lot of handy new features. Some of my favorite include new variable types (`let` and `const`), arrow functions `() => {}`, spread opperators `{...props}`, destructuring `cosnt {thing1, thing2, thing3} = object`, and a bunch of other useful features. Well worth looking into.

## React Router (Advanced)

React Router is a package used by most React Single Page Apps. It's easy to use and written in JSX syntax.

## Webpack (Advanced)

Webpack is a very complicated but useful bundler. It allows for things like hot reloading, `import`, `export`, etc. Webpack is set up by a single `webpack.config.js` file/
